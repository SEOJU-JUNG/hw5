Idea#1
I plan to fill the canvas with some organic jelly shapes. As you click it, organic shapes move organically like puddings. When clicking, it sounds cute, and color changes smoothly. I will use very vivid, bright gradient colors to feel like they are from alien planets. Some bubbles are animating throughout the canvas, as well. 

Idea#2 
Some shapes like triangles, circles, rectangular are falling from the top, and it sounds crushing when each object reaches the bottom. The mouse itself has a little bar to catch falling objects, and when catching some object, you can put them in the box on the side. When you drag them to the box, the caught shapes disappear, meaning that you put them in the box. And a number on the top right, rise as you put the shapes in the box. 

Idea#3
Make a little emoji icon on the right, and on the left, there are some options for emoji skin color, eyes mouth, and accessories. When you click some of the options from the right side, emoji can wear them. So basically, emoji changes as you click the options. And when clicking the options, money checking sounds appear, which means emoji purchased the items. Emoji is animating depends on the item you clicked.
